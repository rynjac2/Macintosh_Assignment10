# Brief Description of the assignment:  This project uses the SpaceX API to retrieve recent launch data, extract relevant information, 
# and save it in CSV format using a Python class-based architecture.
# This module contains the SpaceXClient class, which handles API requests, parses launch data, and writes selected information to a CSV file.
